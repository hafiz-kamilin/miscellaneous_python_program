Find the latest file from specified directory.

## Notes

```
os.path.getmtime(path)
```

Return the time of last modification of path. The return value is a number giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see the time module). Raise os.error if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.

```
os.path.getctime(path)
```
Return the systemâ€™s ctime which, on some systems (like Unix) is the time of the last change, and, on others (like Windows), is the creation time for path. The return value is a number giving the number of seconds since the epoch (see the time module). Raise os.error if the file does not exist or is inaccessible.
